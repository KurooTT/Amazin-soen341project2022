With the uncertainty of many bussiness availabilty to receive clients in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic, users can shop safely using the online website we created.

## Project approach and technology:

The front-end development of the e-commerce application will be created using HTML/CSS and Javascript. 

PHP will be used in the back-end development of the application. SQL will be used in conjunction with PHP as a database to hold the web app's necesary data such as usernames, email addresses and even the products and their prices.

Our team is comprised of software engineers who will focus more on the front-end development, and computer engineers who will focus more on the back-end development of the e-commerce appliacation. 

   ##  Core features:

The application will include the following features:

- Create a login/home page page for three types of users: admin, user, seller.
- Create a products page where sellers can list their products for sale.
- Create a database to store the products that sellers put on the market and the user information.
- Build a Cart for so customers can purchase multiple items at once.
- Create a checkout page so customers can succesfully complete the purchase of thier items.
- Create a secure transaction system and store customers information safely.
